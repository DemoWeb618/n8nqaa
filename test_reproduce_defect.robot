 
Based on the information provided, I'll create a Robot Framework script to reproduce and confirm the login issue in the CURA Healthcare Service application. The script will include both a valid case that should succeed and a test case to verify the reported defect.

```

```

This script includes:
1. Two test cases:
   - One to verify the valid login workflow (which should pass if there's no defect)
   - One to specifically check for the reported white screen defect

2. The script uses the Chrome browser in headless mode with appropriate options for running on AWS EC2 Linux

3. The tests will:
   - Navigate to the application URL
   - Go to the login page
   - Enter the credentials mentioned in the defect report
   - Attempt to log in
   - Verify whether the login was successful or if the defect is reproduced

If the login defect is present, the "Verify Reported Login Defect" test case will capture a screenshot of the white screen, which can be useful for documenting the issue.
