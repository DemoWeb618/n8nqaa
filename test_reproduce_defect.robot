 
I'll create a Robot Framework script to reproduce and confirm the login defect according to the JIRA ticket. The script will include a valid case (successful login) for comparison.

This script includes:

1. A test setup to open the browser with headless Chrome options for AWS EC2 Linux
2. Three test cases:
   - Login with valid credentials (control test)
   - Reproduction of the white screen issue
   - Complete flow test for booking an appointment after login
3. Keywords for each step of the process
4. Verifications to confirm the reported issue

The script will help to determine if the white screen issue is reproducible and if the booking functionality is accessible after login.
